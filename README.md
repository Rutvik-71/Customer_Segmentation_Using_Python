# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their annual income and spending behavior. The objective is to help businesses identify different customer groups and design targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Identify high-value customers
- Understand spending patterns across income groups
- Enable data-driven marketing and customer retention strategies

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about 150 customers with the following attributes:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| CustomerID | Unique customer identifier |
| Gender | Male / Female |
| Age | Age of the customer |
| Annual_Income | Annual income in thousands (k$) |
| Spending_Score | Spending score (1–100) |

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed distributions of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score
- Studied relationships between income and spending behavior

---

## 🤖 Clustering Methodology
- Used **K-Means Clustering**
- Optimal number of clusters selected using **Elbow Method**
- Final number of clusters: **5**

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified 5 distinct customer segments
- Discovered high-income high-spending premium customers
- Found high-income low-spending customers suitable for upselling
- Identified low-income low-spending customers as low priority

---

## 📌 Conclusion
Customer segmentation using K-Means provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps businesses optimize marketing strategies based on data-driven decisions.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Include age-based segmentation
- Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
- Apply other clustering techniques like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering
